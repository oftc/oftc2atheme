This repo contains a script for converting the Postgres database backing
oftc-ircservices as used by OFTC into Atheme's database format, in preparation
for an eventual migration to Atheme as OFTC's services software.

Special thanks to Matthew Martin (phy1729) for writing the vast majority of this
script!
